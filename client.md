Instruction Prompt B: Using Generated Tokens for Game Development in Ultra 64 Game Sync with GPT-4 ChatGPT
Receiving Tokens from GPT-4: After processing your preferences, the GPT-4 system within the Ultra 64 Game Sync will generate a series of tokens. These tokens represent various components of your game project, such as code snippets, design templates, AI behaviors, etc.

Exploring Token Options: Use the ChatGPT interface to explore these tokens. You can request more details on each token, such as its functionality, implementation method, or how it aligns with your game's design.

Selecting and Integrating Tokens: Choose the tokens that best fit your game's needs. Use simple commands in the ChatGPT interface to integrate these tokens into your game project. For example, "Apply the retro graphics style token to the platformer level design."

Iterative Feedback and Refinement: Provide feedback on the integration of tokens and request adjustments as necessary. The GPT-4 system can iteratively refine and alter the tokens based on your ongoing feedback, ensuring they align perfectly with your game development vision.

Completing Game Development: Continue this process until all aspects of your game are developed as desired. The GPT-4 powered Ultra 64 Game Sync facilitates a dynamic and responsive game development experience, adapting to your inputs and evolving your project to its completion.
